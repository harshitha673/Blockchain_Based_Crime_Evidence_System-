# Blockchain_Based_Crime_Evidence_System-
In traditional crime evidence management systems, all data is stored on centralized servers that are vulnerable to tampering by administrators or malicious actors, compromising the integrity of criminal investigations. To address this critical issue, the proposed system employs blockchain technology to securely manage and store crime evidence details in a decentralized and tamper-proof manner. By leveraging Ethereum-based blockchain and smart contracts written in Solidity, the system ensures that every piece of evidence is stored as an immutable transaction linked by cryptographic hashes. Any attempt to alter data is immediately detected through hash mismatches, preserving the authenticity of records.The system features role-based access with separate modules for administrators and officers, enabling secure addition and retrieval of evidence data via a Django web interface. Admins can register officers and monitor all recorded cases, while officers can upload and access evidence directly into the blockchain. The use of smart contracts provides programmable control over data operations, and detailed logs such as transaction IDs and block numbers ensure transparency. This approach offers a robust, secure, and traceable platform for crime evidence handling, significantly enhancing the reliability and integrity of criminal justice procedures.
Crime investigation and evidence management systems are critical components of law enforcement. However, traditional systems rely heavily on centralized databases, which are vulnerable to data tampering, unauthorized access, and lack transparency. Altering crime evidence records can lead to wrongful acquittals or convictions, undermining the justice system.
To address these vulnerabilities, this project proposes a Blockchain Based Crime Evidence System. By leveraging the decentralized and tamper-proof architecture of blockchain technology, this system ensures that crime evidence is stored securely and immutably across distributed nodes. Each evidence entry is treated as a block containing a unique hash, and any attempt to alter the data would disrupt the hash chain, thereby making tampering detectable and preventable.
The system employs Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts written in Solidity to store, retrieve, and manage evidence data. Smart contracts provide programmable, transparent, and verifiable logic for data interaction, ensuring evidence integrity throughout its lifecycle.
Key users of the system include:
•	Admin (Police Department): Responsible for registering officers and monitoring the system.
•	Officers: Authorized personnel who can add and retrieve crime evidence.
The platform also integrates a user-friendly interface supported by a Python backend, allowing users to interact with the blockchain seamlessly. Real-time logs including block numbers, transaction hashes, and status updates ensure transparency and accountability for each action taken within the system.
This project demonstrates a secure, decentralized, and transparent approach to evidence management using blockchain, significantly enhancing the integrity and trust in the criminal justice process.
The "Blockchain Based Crime Evidence System" successfully demonstrates how blockchain technology can be leveraged to secure, decentralize, and authenticate crime evidence records. Traditional centralized crime evidence systems are vulnerable to tampering, primarily due to unrestricted access by administrators and the lack of traceable audit trails. By using blockchain's immutable and transparent ledger, this system ensures that once evidence is recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted without detection.
Through smart contracts deployed on Ethereum and integrated with a user-friendly Python-based frontend, both administrators and officers can safely add, retrieve, and view evidence-related data. The system effectively captures transaction metadata such as block numbers and hash codes, enabling traceability and forensic accountability. This solution significantly enhances the reliability of digital crime evidence handling and fosters greater trust in legal proceedings.
